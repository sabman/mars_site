Feature: Only allow admin to create, update and delete Samples, Surveys and SampleData
  In order to protect MARS data
  As a MARS Admin 
  I want to restrict access to MARS admin link

  Scenario: no one logged in and show samples page
    Given I am logged out
    When I go to a sample page
    Then I should not see "Edit"
    And I should not see "Destroy"
    And I should not see "Create"
    
  Scenario: when not logged in, following the edit destroy create links don't work
